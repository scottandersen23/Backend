# Add a webhook endpoint (e.g., subscriptions/paypal_webhooks.py) that listens for PayPal 
# events like payment captures, subscription cancellations, or reactivations. Update UserSubscription or Transaction models accordingly.

# Recurring Logic: When PayPal processes recurring payments, it sends events to the webhook. 
# You can mark transactions as paid and keep your system in sync.
